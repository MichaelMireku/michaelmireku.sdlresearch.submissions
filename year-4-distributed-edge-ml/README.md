# Year 4 - Distributed Systems & Applied Edge ML

Goal: Build strong foundations in distributed architectures, cloud/edge integration, and applied ML pipelines

## Phases

### Phase 1: Advanced Distributed Systems Fundamentals (Weeks 1-12)
- Consensus protocols (Raft, Paxos)
- Fault tolerance, replication, sharding

### Phase 2: Networking, Messaging & Edge Deployment (Weeks 15-25)
- RPC, sockets, message queues
- Edge node simulation

### Phase 3: Applied ML Pipelines (Weeks 28-38)
- Model chunking/versioning
- Weight verification
- Training/fine-tuning pipelines

### Phase 4: Integration Project (Weeks 41-52)
- Distributed ML system combining consensus, replication, and edge inference
